# Lesson 1 Part 1 -  HTML 101

 HTML is short for Hypertext Markup Languge.
 It is used for creating web pages. 
 It uses text instead of blocks.
 We will also learn CSS (Castcading Stylesheets).


  We are finally in the basics, open [texteditor.co](https://texteditor.co/) on your computer
  to start. 
 Now write:
 
 ```
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <!--the doctype html will start the code-->
 <html>
 <head>
 <!---head, title, html, and body are tags-->
  <title>
  My HTML Page
  </title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
 </head>
 <body>
 </body>
 </html>
 ```
 This is the basic html code.

# Lesson 1 Part 2 - Text

Now Write in between ``` <body> ``` and ``` </body> ```:

```
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>Write anything in here</p>

```

Your code should look like this:

```

<!DOCTYPE html>
 <!--the doctype html will start the code-->
 <html>
 <head>
 <!---head, title, html, and body are tags-->
  <title>
  My HTML Page
  </title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
 </head>
 <body>
 <h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>Write anything in here</p> </body>
 </html>
 
 ```
