# Lesson 1 - What Is HTML

 HTML is short for Hypertext Markup Languge.
 It is used for creating web pages. 
 It uses text instead of blocks.
 We will also learn CSS (Castcading Stylesheets) and some JavaScript.

 ##  The Basics

  We are finally in the basics, open [texteditor.co](https://texteditor.co/) on your computer
  to start. 
 Now write:
 
 ```
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <!--the doctype html will start the code-->
 
 <head>
  <title>
  My HTML Page
  </title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
 </head>
 <body>
 </body>
 
 ```
 This is the basic html code.
